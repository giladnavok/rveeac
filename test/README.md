# Testing

- tb_core : A basic test with isolated instructions
- tb_core_simple_prog : Test the core with test_prog.c; Test stops on the infinite while loop at the end of main and then prints the first main stack variable which is 'pass' in test_prog.c.  

other tests are for an earlier version of some modules, can be converted to a relevant one in the future
